This is personal project of Automation using Katalon. The website that is used to be automated is Tokopedia. The Scenario that I covered for the automation are :
1. Login as Consumer
~2. Search Item~
~3. Add To Cart~
~4. Access Cart Page~
~5. Delete item from Cart~

Update 10/10/2025: i just realized maybe Tokopedia has a protection against automation or bot, that is why when i tried to login successfully using valid credentials the system ask for a verification, but either option i choosed was set to failed to send. so In this Project will discountinued. will work on another project automation as exercise
